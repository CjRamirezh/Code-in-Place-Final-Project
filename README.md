# Code-in-Place-Final-Project
Hi everyone! This is the code of my final project of Code in Place.

This program will analyze a whatsapp chat from your choice, all you have to do is export a chat from
Whatsapp and save the .txt file in the same folder as the main.py archive, then run the program and
choose from the different options.

For privacy reasons i will not put a '_chat.txt' file in the repository, but you can take your own going to the chat info in Whatsapp and selecting the export chat option.

Hope you like it!
